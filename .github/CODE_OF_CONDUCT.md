# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct for the MusicBrainz Picard Documentation Project is taken almost verbatim from the [MetaBrainz Code of Conduct](https://github.com/metabrainz/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which covers the MusicBrainz Picard project.  Even though this documentation project is not an official MetaBrainz Foundation project, the principles conveyed apply equally to this documentation project.

1. Be polite. Remember that there's a real person on the receiving end of any communication. Treat people as you'd wish to be treated yourself.

2. Remember that everyone was new at some point and a polite nudge in the right direction is sometimes all that it takes to set them on the right path.

3. Don't get into flame wars, and try to remain as neutral as possible. Do not attack someone personally because you don't agree with them.

4. MetaBrainz projects, including MusicBrainz Picard, have global communities. Be mindful and respectful of different languages, habits and cultures.

5. Share knowledge freely. New members should not be embarrassed for ignorance.

6. Respectfully suggest other options. Not everyone wants to reconfigure their directories, change their OS or switch players and formats.

7. Try not to start fights by [nit-picking](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nitpicking) other contributors.

8. Use gender neutral language whenever possible. Unless actually talking about genders or specific people, there is no reason to use gendered language. As we touch older work that is not gender neutral, we should make an effort to make it gender neutral.
