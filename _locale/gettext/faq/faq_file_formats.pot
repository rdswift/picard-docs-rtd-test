msgid "Please understand that Picard is not designed as a general purpose :index:`tag editor <tags; editing>`. Its primary goal is to retrieve community-maintained MusicBrainz data to write into your tags. Some secondary goals include:"

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:55
msgid "allowing rule-based customization of that data using scripts and plugins"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:56
msgid "encouraging users to create an account and fix and update data via the MusicBrainz website, thus sharing their work with the rest of the community rather than simply fixing their tags locally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/faq_file_formats.rst:59
msgid "To that end, Picard is likely to never have as much development focus on manual bulk editing of tags as other general purpose editors (e.g.: `Mp3tag <https://www.mp3tag.de/en/>`_, `foobar2000 <https://www.foobar2000.org/>`_, or even many library managers such as iTunes, Windows Media Player, and MediaMonkey).
