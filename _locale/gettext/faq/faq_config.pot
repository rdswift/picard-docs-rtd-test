msgid "First, you need to force :index:`iTunes <itunes>` to re-read the information from your tags and update its library. This is discussed in the `iTunes Guide <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/iTunes_Guide>`_."

#: ../../faq/faq_config.rst:26
msgid "Additionally, iTunes has a known bug in its ID3v2.4 implementation, which makes it unable to read such tags if they also contain embedded cover art. As a work-around, you can configure Picard to write ID3v2.3 tags."

#: ../../faq/faq_config.rst:31
msgid "Prior to version 0.14, Picard's default settings were to write ID3v2.4 and ID3v1 tags to files. WMP can't read ID3v2.4, so it falls back to ID3v1 which has a limitation of 30 characters per title. To solve this on versions prior to 0.14, configure Picard to write ID3v2.3 tags instead."

msgid "Starting with version 0.14, the default settings have been changed to ID3v2.3 and this should no longer be an issue."
