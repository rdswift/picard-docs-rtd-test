msgid "Although ID3v2.4 is the latest version, its support in music players is still lacking. While some software has no problem using version 2.4 tags, others may not be able to read the tags and display the information. Support for ID3v2.4 in other media players (such as smartphones) is variable."

msgid "As mentioned above, ID3v2.3 does not support multi-value tags, and so Picard flattens these to strings before saving them to ID3v2.3 tags. This setting defines the string used to separate the values when flattened. Use '; ' for the greatest compatibility (rather than '/' since tags more often contain a '/' than a ';') and for the best visual compatibility in Picard between ID3v2.3 and other tagging formats."
