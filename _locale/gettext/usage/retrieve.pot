msgid "This is the preferred method of automatically identifying the album to retrieve, and should be used when you have the CD available.  Typically this would be used right after ripping the audio files from the CD.  When initiated, the table of contents (toc) is read from the CD and a request is sent to MusicBrainz to return a list of the releases that match the toc.  If there are any matches, then they will be listed for you to select the one to use.  If there are no matches or none of the matches are correct, you can search the database manually for the matching album, and are given the option of attaching the toc from your CD to the selected release for future lookup."
