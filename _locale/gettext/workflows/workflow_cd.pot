msgid "This is perhaps the best case scenario, because it provides the greatest chance of tagging your music files with the most accurate match from the MusicBrainz database.  It is also one of the easier methods for looking up the release."

msgid "Extract the music filed from the CD using your favorite ripping program (e.g.: `Exact Audio Copy <http://exactaudiocopy.de/>`_ for Windows or `Whipper <https://github.com/whipper-team/whipper>`_ for Linux). The format for the output files depends on your personal preference and the formats supported by your player. A popular format is FLAC, which is a compressed lossless format."

msgid "If there is only one release that matches the disc id for your disc, it will be loaded automatically.  Before proceeding, please check to ensure that it properly matches your CD (e.g.: release country, date and label, catalog number, barcode, media type, and cover art).  This is especially important if you are going to submit any information such as disc id or AcoustID fingerprints."
