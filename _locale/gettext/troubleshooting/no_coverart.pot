msgid "It's possible that the selected release does not have any cover art available from the enabled cover art providers. If a cover art image is displayed for the release on the MusicBrainz website, it is possible that the image for the release group is being displayed, or it is being provided through a third-party provider agreement.  Sometimes this can be addressed by enabling the \"CAA Release Group\" and \"Whitelist\" provider options."

msgid "On occasion, the server providing the cover art (e.g.: archive.org) is not available, or mirror servers have not yet been synchronized with the latest updates.  In this case, you may have to wait for a few minutes before retrying your request. Reviewing the details in Picard's log often provides some insight into whether or not this is the issue."

You can have Picard use the cover art from pending edits by disabling the \"Download only approved images\" option in the Cover Art Archives subsection of the :menuselection:`\"Options --> Options... --> Cover Art\"` settings.  Please see the :doc:`../config/options_cover_art_archive` section for more information."

Some players support embedded images, some support images stored as files in the directory (e.g.: \"cover.jpg\" or \"folder.jpg\"), and some support both. Picard allows you to specify how the cover art images should be saved.  Please see the :doc:`../config/options_location` section of the Coverart options for details."
