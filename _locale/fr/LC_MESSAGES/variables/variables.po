"This describes both Tags which are saved inside your music files and can "
"be read by your music player, and Picard variables which can be used in "
"Picard scripts for tagging, file renaming, and in several other more "

"All tags are also available as variables, but additional variables which "
"start with an underscore '_' are not saved as Tags within your music "
"files (e.g. ``_my_tag_not_saved``)."

"Variables are used in scripts by wrapping the name between percent '%' "
"characters (e.g. ``%title%``)."

"Some variables can contain more than one value (e.g. "
"``musicbrainz_artistid``), and if you want to use only one of the values "
"then you will need to use special script functions to access or set them."
" To access all the multiple values at once, use the variable normally and"
" Picard will combine them into a single string separated by a semicolon "
"and space (e.g.: \"Item 1; Item 2; Item 3\")."

"If a tag description indicates a later version of Picard than the current"
" official version on the downloads page, then the tag is beta "
"functionality which will be available in the next official release. A "
"description of how to gain access to these beta versions for testing can "
"be found on the `Picard downloads page "
"<https://picard.musicbrainz.org/downloads/>`_ on the website."
