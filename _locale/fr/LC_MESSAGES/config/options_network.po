"The browser integration allows you to load releases and recordings into "
"Picard directly from the MusicBrainz website. Once you have opened "
"musicbrainz.org in your browser from Picard, the website will show the "
"green tagger button |lookup_tagger| next to releases and recordings.  "
"Clicking on this button will load the corresponding release or recording "
"into Picard."

"This identifies the default port Picard will listen on for the browser "

"By default Picard will limit access to the browser integration port to "
"your local machine. Deactivating this option will expose the port on your"
" network, allowing you to request Picard to load a specific release or "
"recording via the network. For example, this would be used for the "
"`Picard Barcode Scanner "
"<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.musicbrainz.picard.barcodescanner>`_"
" Android app."

"Only expose the port externally when you actually need it and only on "
"networks you trust. Exposing application ports via the network can open "
"potential security holes on your system."
