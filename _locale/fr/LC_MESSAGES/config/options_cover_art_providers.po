"one provider and choose the order in which the providers are queried. "

"The Cover Art Archive (CAA) is the MusicBrainz archive of cover art in "

"This provider uses the Cover Art Archive cover image assigned to the "
"release group. This is usually the image that best describes the release "
"group as a whole or the image with the best visual quality, but is not "
"necessarily the exact cover of the release you are tagging. This provider"
" is a good choice if you care more about visual quality then having an "
"exact representation of your release. It is also a good fallback for the "
"Cover Art Archive provider."
