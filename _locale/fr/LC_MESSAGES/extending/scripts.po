"There are two types of scripts used in Picard: the file naming script and"
" tagging scripts. These are managed from the \"File Naming\" and "
"\"Scripting\" sections of the :menuselection:`\"Options --> Options...\"`"
" menu. All scripts are written using the :doc:`Picard scripting language "
"<scripting>`. Scripts are often discussed in the `MetaBrainz Community "
"Forum <https://community.metabrainz.org/>`_, and there is a thread "
"specific to `file naming and script snippets "
"<https://community.metabrainz.org/t/repository-for-neat-file-name-string-"
"patterns-and-tagger-script-snippets/2786/>`_."

"There is only one file naming script defined in a user’s settings, "
"although it can vary from a simple one-line script such as "
"``%album%/%title%`` to a very complex script using different file naming "
"formats based on different criteria. In all cases, the files will be "
"saved using the text output by the script."

"There can be multiple tagging scripts defined in a user’s settings. "
"Individual scripts can be enabled or disabled, and the order of execution"
" of the scripts can be set. Whenever a script is run automatically (i.e.:"
" when an album is loaded), it is processed once for each track in the "
"album that triggered the run. For example, if there are two tagging "
"scripts enabled (A and B) and an album with three tracks is loaded, the "
"scripts will be processed in the following order:"

"Any new tags set or tags modified by the tagging scripts will be written "
"to the output files' metadata, unless the tag name begins with an "
"underscore. These \"hidden\" tags are typically used as variables to hold"
" temporary values that are used later in either the tagging or file "
"naming scripts. Tagging scripts are run once for each track in the data, "
"using the metadata for that track."

"Tagging scripts can also be run manually by right-clicking either an "
"album or a track in the right-hand pane in Picard. If run from the album "
"entry, the script is run for each track in the album. If run from an "
"individual track, the script is only run for that track."
